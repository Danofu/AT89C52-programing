# AT89C52 Microprocessor programing

### The four C codes for each `AT89C52` microprocessor were written with [µVision IDE](https://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision) and used in a circuit simulation with [Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com)

>   - identifies and understands each button press signal from a phone keypad
>   - listens and speaks to other microprocessors
> - Second AT89C52:
>   - displays information on a two-part 7-sigment display
>   - listens and speaks to other microprocessors
> - Third AT89C52:
>   - controls two motors speed and rotation direction
>   - listens and speaks to other microprocessors
> - Fourth AT89C52:
>   - showing information on a JM164ASPEC display
>   - uses custom characters on a JM164ASPEC display
>   - listens to other microprocessors
